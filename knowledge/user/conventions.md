# Engineering Conventions & Standards

Guidelines enforced across the CAGY project:

1. **Hermetic & Zero-Dependency Testing**:
   - Always write tests with standard library `unittest` (never external `pytest`) to guarantee zero-dependency execution across host and container environments.
   - See [[architecture/cagy_unified]] for test runner integration.
2. **Container Path Confinement**:
   - All tool executions, shell commands, and file operations resolve inside `/workspace` or relative paths. Do not reference host `/Users/...` paths.
   - Referenced in [[user/profile]].
3. **Multi-Architecture Integrity**:
   - Maintain full compatibility with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` via Docker Buildx.
   - See [[decisions/adr_001_cagy_fork]] for context on decoupling legacy code.
